## Section 1 Python Basics

Expressions are the most basic type of instructions in Python. Expression = Values + Operators. Expressions always reduce to a single value.

>>> 2 + 2
4

Order of operations by Precedance 
1. Exponents **
2. Modulus/remainder %
3. Integer Division/floored quotient //
4. Division /
5. Multiplcation *
6. Subtraction - 
7. Addition +

Parentheses overrides and goes first ()

Whole numbers are called Intergers or "ints"
Decimal numbers are called Floading Point or "floats"

Text values are called Strings surrounded by quotes such as 'hello world'

String concatenation joins strings together 
>>> 'hello' + 'world'
'helloworld'
>>> 'alice' + 'bob'
'alicebob'

String Replication repeats strings
>>> 'Alice' * 3
'AliceAliceAlice'

Combine concatenation with replication. Note the order of operations here
>>> 'Hello' + '!' * 10
'Hello!!!!!!!!!!'

Variable is a box that holds values
>>> spam = 42
>>> spam
42

If Python instruction evaluates to a single value then its an expression, if not its a statement.

len() - returns string length value
input() - allows the user to type in a value

functions to change data types

str() - returns string value 
>>> str(26)
'26'

int() - returns integer value
>>> int('1234')
1234

float() - returns floating point value
>>> float(1)
1.0
Notice the decimal added here
