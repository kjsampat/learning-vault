# Match Specific Positions

Match Starting
- Use a caret outside a character set to search for patterns at the beginning of strings
- `^` 

Example  `/^Ricky/`  would match for the  `Ricky` at the start of a string. 
	- This will not work unless `Ricky`  is at the start of the string. 


Match Ending
- Use dollar sign at the end of the regex 
- `/story$/`
