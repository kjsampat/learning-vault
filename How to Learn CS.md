How to Learn CS


1. Read/Watch the topic
	- Get a basic overview of the topic
	- Before reading look at the pages, see how long the chapter is, look for headlines, bold print and images, get an idea of what the chapter is about
	- Is there a quiz or questions at the end of the chapter or section. Now while reading you're reading with focused attention
	- Try to understand how the topic relates to the overall subject
	- Don't worry about trying to understand everything. You may be confused. Or your mind may wander or you may get sleepy. 
	- Don't worry about taking notes or highlighting. 
	- Read the first and last sentance of each paragraph.
	- Don't read for comprehesion. Read for exposure. 

2. Close the topic. Try to write down what you just learned on a piece of paper. Try to create examples (don't copy the provided examples).
	- You most likely will write down very little and have more questions than answers. 
	- As these questions pop up. Write them down. 
	- Take note of any concepts that need explaining

3. Re-Read/Watch the topic
	- Repitition is the mother of learning
	- This time take notes. Paper or digital.
	- Try to answer the questions that came up in the previous step. 
	- Try to clarify any concepts that needed explaining further.
	- Create examples in your notes, but try to create a new example not copy the existing one.
	- Write your notes into questions. This creates active recall as you review.

4. Write down what you have learned. This time you should be able to write much more down than before.
	- Explain the concept as you are writing it down.
	- Pretend you are teaching someone the concept.
	- Create examples
	- As previously take note of any questions that pop up or concepts that need further clarification.

5. Re-run steps 3-4 as many times as needed until you understand the concept fully and can explain it very simply.
	- Add additional study materials as needed to fill in your understanding.
