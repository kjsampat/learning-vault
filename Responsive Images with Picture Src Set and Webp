Things to Consider

ACF object vs id
Picture or Img Tag or CSS background image
Src set and Sizes

Display WebP if browser supports. Fallback 
Simple Workflow
Lazyload Lazysizes.js
Background position 
Image optimization for fallbacks
How does SVGs work in this workflow
Content area - Images added by writers
